This is an original short narrative about psychological growh and it's not a very user-friendly story - the story is a bit vague on purpose and not immediately apparent, but that's the whole point - growing up is neither a clear, straight forward process nor an easily comprehendible one. I understand that everyone's experience is different and that I cannot claim that everyone goes through the same process, but I think that in general the quote by Hermann Hesse stands true.
