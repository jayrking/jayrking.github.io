So I wrote this story and made some doodles to go with it.

I know that

It's not a very friendly story

Unless you know someone who's really under-socialized

And you understand how terrible it is to deal with them, haha

When that someone is your biological mother 

You start to think about things

And that's what inspired this short story

Because terrible people make for good stories
