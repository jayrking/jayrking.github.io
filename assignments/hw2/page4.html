                    What do you call someone who speaks three languages? A trilingual. <br>Two languages? Bilingual. One language? An American.
                    <br>Sure, you might only know how to speak American, <br>but you're in for some luck because English remains <br>a much desired language
                    around the world, and you might<br> be able to score a job abroad teaching English abroad. <br>Best part? You don't even have to be particularly good at English!
